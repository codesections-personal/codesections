I've built a couple different simple web apps for interacting with Mastodon using it's REST API and Oauth.

First, I built [Tool for Tabulating Thirty Top Tooters](https://t5.codesections.com), which allows users to find other users they've favorated the most.  ([source](https://github.com/codesections/t5)).

Second, I built [Mastodon-de-mob](https://mastodon-de-mob.codesections.com/), a tool designed to help prevent harassment by letting users block all the users who boosted or favorated a harassing toot.  I hope it's never needed, but I'll be glad I built it in advance if it is.
