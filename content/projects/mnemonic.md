The CLI app for remembering those little things that slip your mind.

This Rust Command-Line Interface app allows users to quickly and easily store notes straight from their terminal and then later edit, delete, or supplement those notes. Users can display the notes with full syntax highlighting, (including for Markdown). Additionally, users can configure the app either through command-line flags or a seperate .toml configuration file.
