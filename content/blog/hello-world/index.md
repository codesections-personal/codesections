Welcome!  Don’t you just love that new-blog smell?

This blog is my new home for technical topics, book reviews, whatever else
catches my attention.  I firmly believe that web developers should have their
own digital space, one that they build, control, and fully understand.  For
me, this site is that space.

## Colophon
As of this writing, this site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
(**EDIT**: The site is now built with Gutenberg, which is [much better
than Hugo](https://www.codesections.com/blog/gutenberg-vs-hugo/)) the
leading static site generator.  It uses a self-written theme and the source
code lives in a publicly available [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/dsock/codesections) (**EDIT**: Now a
[GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/codesections/codesections-website)).
If you’re curious about what I was trying to achieve with this site, I’ve
written <a href="/projects/this-website">a whole page</a> about what
I was aiming for and how well I did.

## Past writing
While this is the first post on this blog, it’s far from the first public
writing I’ve done.  Past highlights include:

## Writing a Brief for the iPad Judge
One of my first attempts at linking law and technology—and probably the most
widely read item I’ve written so far—was [a post about how legal writing
should change](https://cblr.columbia.edu/writing-a-brief-for-the-ipad-judge)
a post about how legal writing should change when the audience might be
reading it on a tablet or other mobile device.  This post was linked and
discussed by [The Volokh
Conspiracy](http://volokh.com/2014/01/17/writing-briefs-judges-read-ipads/),
[The Researching Paralegal](https://researchingparalegal.com/2014/01/28/do-you-know-whether-your-judge-uses-an-ipad-or-tablet-find-out-before-you-submit-your-next-brief),
[Simple Justice](http://blog.simplejustice.us/2014/01/27/its-not-just-a-formatting-thing/),
[At Counsel Table](https://atcounseltable.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/3-ways-to-make-your-brief-read-better-on-an-ipad/),
and others.
  

## Legal and Academic Writing
As a lawyer and student, I also wrote a ton—though most of that writing was on
behalf of a client or employer or otherwise isn’t publicly available.  One
item that _is_ available, however, is the Law Review article I published,
[Deterring Discovery-Driven Deletions of
Data](https://cblr.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sockwell-Intro-+-TOC.pdf).
This article also lay at the intersection of law and technology, and argued
that the legal framework around civil litigation creates incentives for
companies to delete data that could be be incredibly useful in the right hands.
