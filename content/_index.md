<h2 class="site-header">Iâ€™m Daniel Sockwell, a software developer who started coding in an odd way:  I was a lawyer in New York, when my firm needed a coding lawyer.</h2>

Since then, I've built projects [in JavaScript](https://github.com/codesections/mastodon-de-mob), [in Rust](https://github.com/codesections/mnemonic), or in [whatever other](https://github.com/codesections/pass-gen) language seemed [best for the job](https://github.com/codesections/gtypist_programming_characters).  I'm a firm believer in the power of free and open-source software and have contributed to [dozens of open-source projects](https://github.com/codesections-forks).  I've been particularly involved in the Rust ecosystem, and serve on the Rust [Command Line Application working group](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-cli-working-group/6872).

My longer writings are here at [codesections.com/blog](https://www.codesections.com/blog/) and my microbloging is hosted at <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@codesections">fosstodon.org/@codesections</a> (part of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), the distributed, open-source social network).  If you have any questions or just want to say "hi", feel free to shoot me an email at `daniel@codesections.com`, or reach out through [any other contact method](https://codesections.com/about/#contact).
