<h2 class="site-header">I’m Daniel Sockwell, a software developer building free software.</h2>

Hi.  I'm a free-software developer and, these days, I mostly work in and on [Raku](https://docs.raku.org/) 
– a concise, expressive,
aggressively multiparadigm language that supports gradual typing, built-in concurrency,
rich metaprogramming, and best-in-class, Unicode-first string processing and pattern matching.
I also program a fair amount in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (perfect for when I need the 
performance that comes from being closer to the metal) and in 
[JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html).

Before discovering my interest in/apptitude for programming, I was an attorney practicing in the
New York office of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.  These days, in addition to my software develoment 
work, I'm a member of the [Raku Steering Council](https://raku.github.io/Raku-Steering-Council/) 
and [The Perl & Raku Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/) board. My professional interests
include web development, open source, and making things as simple as possible.

I blog here on [www.codesections.com/blog](https://www.codesections.com/blog/) and share
my shorter thoughts using the distributed, open-source social network
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) under the username <a rel="me"
href="https://fosstodon.org/@codesections">@codesections@fosstodon.org</a> .  If you have
any questions or just want to say "hi", feel free to email me at `daniel@codesections.com`
or to reach out through [any other contact method](https://codesections.com/contact).
