<h2 class="site-header">I’m Daniel Sockwell, a software developer building free software.</h2>

A few years ago, I was a practicing attorney working on high-stakes, eight-figure
commercial litigation with a firm in New York.  But then, a funny thing happened: my firm
needed a lawyer to learn to program (it's a long story) volunteered and I fell in love
with coding.  Within a year, I'd transitioned to full-time software development – although
I've maintained my law license.

These days, I mostly work in and on [Raku](https://docs.raku.org/) – a concise, expressive,
aggressively multiparadigm language that supports gradual typing, built-in concurrency,
rich metaprogramming, and best-in-class, Unicode-first string processing and pattern matching.  In
addition to coding in Raku, I serve on the Raku Steering Council and on the Raku/Perl
legal committee.  I also program a fair amount in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
(perfect for when I need the performance that comes from being closer to the metal) and
[JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html).

I blog here on [www.codesections.com/blog](https://www.codesections.com/blog/) and share
my shorter thoughts using the distributed, open-source social network
[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) under the username <a rel="me"
href="https://fosstodon.org/@codesections">@codesections@fosstodon.org</a> .  If you have
any questions or just want to say "hi", feel free to email me at `daniel@codesections.com`
or to reach out through [any other contact
method](https://codesections.com/contact).
