  This page is about me, Daniel Sockwell, the person.  If you're interested in
  details about this site, there’s a [separate page for
  that](../projects) (or you can just [check out the source code for this
  site](https://gitlab.com/codesections/codesections-website)).
</asside>

I’m Daniel, and I’m on a mission to bridge the gap between law and
technology.  Before embarking on this project, I  was an attorney at a major
New York law firm, where my practice focused on civil litigation and
emphasised cybersecurity, data privacy, and other intersections between law
and technology.

I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and have also lived in California,
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, and Texas.  When I’m not working on
programming or legal topics, you can find me out hiking in the backcountry,
reading a science fiction book, or playing a board game with my wife ([Race for
the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy) is a 
current favorite).

In addition to my [blog](/blog) here on CodeSections, I also post shorter 
content to Mastodon.  You can follow me there at
[fosstodon.org/@CodeSections](https://fosstodon.org/@codesections).  I also 
maintain a profile at [KeyBase](https://keybase.io/codesections), which
cryptographically verifies my different online identities.  If you
would like to contact me more directly, feel free to send me an email at
<daniel@codesections.com>.  And if you would like that email to be encrypted
feel free to use my [public key](/public-key.txt).
