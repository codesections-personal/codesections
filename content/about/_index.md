<asside class="note">This page is about me, Daniel Sockwell, the person.  If you're interested in details about this site, there’s a [separate page for
that](../projects).
</asside>

I’m Daniel, and I’m on a mission to bridge the gap between law and technology.  Before embarking on this project, I  was an attorney at a major New York law firm, where my practice focused on civil litigation and emphasised cybersecurity, data privacy, and other intersections between law and technology.

I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and have also lived in California, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, and Texas.  When I’m not working on programming or legal topics, you can find me out hiking in the backcountry, reading a science fiction book, or playing a board game with my wife (Race for the Galaxy is a current favorite).
