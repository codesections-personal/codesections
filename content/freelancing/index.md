In addition to working on [my Free Software projects](https://github.com/codesections) and
serving in leadership roles for the [Raku programming language](https://raku.org), I am also
available for paid contract or consulting work on a freelance basis. 

I give preference to Open Source/Free Software projects but will consider non-Open-Source projects
as well. My primary programming languages are Raku, Rust, and JavaScript; I will consider projects
in other programming languages on a case-by-case basis. Past clients have included [Mastodon
gGmbH](https://joinmastodon.org/about) and [The Perl and Raku
Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/). References are available on request.

If you would like to discuss a potential project, please email <freelancing@codesections.com>.
