  <h1> About this site</h1>

  In building this website, I had three main goals.  I wanted the site to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have understandable source code,</li>
    <li>be self-sufficient, and</li>
    <li>be the fastest site in the world.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="content-p">This page is about how well I managed to meet these goals.</p>

  <h3>Understandable Source Code</h3>

  <p class="content-p">Why do I want to write a page with understandable source code?  To answer that, I want to first talk about Richard Feynman and transistor radios.</p>

  <p class="content-p">The Nobel-prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman wrote about his early childhood experience repairing transistor radios in the 1930s.  In case you haven't seen a transistor radio, they look like this:</p>

  <img src="/resources/images/transistor-radio.jpg" width="100%" caption="Transistor radio; image credit: Wikipedia">

  <p class="content-p">By contrast, a modern radio receiver is so small that millions of people <a class="link" href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/unlock-the-secret-fm-tuner-in-your-android-phone/">had one inside their cellphones and didn't even realize it.</a></p>

  <p class="content-p">Why am I talking about radios on a page about this website?  Because Feynman was able to learn and apply basic physics in a way that children today basically can't.  Radios have gotten too miniaturized, have had their complexity hidden away where no one can learn from it.  And I see the same thing happening with websites</p>

  <p class="content-p"> Here's a (slightly modified) copy of the markup from the beginning of <a class="link" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">an extremely early website</a>:</p>

  <script type="text/plain">
<head>
  <title>The World Wide Web project</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>World Wide Web</h1>

  <p>The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area
  <a name=0 href="WhatIs.html">hypermedia</a>
  information retrieval initiative aiming to
  give universal access to a large universe
  of documents.</p>

  <p>Everything there is online about W3 is
  linked directly or indirectly to this document,
  including an <a href="Summary.html">executive
  summary</a> of the project.</p>
  </script>
  <p class="content-p">Even if you've never read a word of markup before in your life, you can probably just about figure out what that does—that it creates a header (with a title for the page) and then creates a body of the document that consists of several paragraphs with some text and a few links to other html pages.</p>

  <p class="content-p">In contrast to that, consder this excerpt from the markup for a <a class="link" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/flashback-this-is-what-the-first-website-ever-looked-like-2011-6"> modern news article</a> <em>about</em> that early site.  The markup starts like this:</p>
  <script type="text/plain">

  ,__nr_require=function(t,n,e){
    function r(e){if(!n[e]){var o=n[e]={exports:
      {}};t[e][0].call(o.exports,function(n){
        var o=t[e][1][n];return r(o||n)},o,o.exports)
      }return n[e].exports}if("function"==typeof __nr_require)
      return __nr_require;for(var o=0;o<e.length;o++)r(e[o]);
      return r}
</script>
<p class="content-p">That is, with javascript that has been inlined an minified to the point of being gibberish, even to experienced programers. Even if we give the article the benefit of skipping past 502 lines (!) of inline javascript, we get to this: </p>

<p class="content-p">All that is to say that html and css markup, at their best, can be like the transistor radio.  They can be a toy that anyone motivated and curious enough can pull apart and see how it works.  For so many of today's programers, who grew up with (or before) the Internet, that's exactly what html was.</p>

<p class="content-p">But I worry that today's html is much more like the tiny, miniaturized radio inside a cell phone—a marvel of engineering, perhaps, but so complex that it (seems to be) outside the realm of understanding for any non-expert.</p>

<p class="content-p">So, with this website, I'm pushing back against that trend.  I've built a highly performant, modern website—but one with markup that is just as understandable as the websites from 1991. Like the radios that Feynman repaired, this is a website that anyone can take apart to see how it works.</p>

<p class="content-p">To that end, I've left in the comments and have not minified any of the source.  This bloats the page a bit, because those comments get sent to your computer even if you don't read them.   Nevertheless, I've kept the page tiny and <em>fast</em>—the total page weight is still under 14kb, which means it loads in a single http request.</p>

<p class="content-p">Below, I have an annotated copy of the markup from the home page.  Anytime I do something non-standard or that is debatable, I'll provide a comment explaining why I made the choice I did and what I'm trying to achieve. If you disagree with any of my choices, feel free to let me know via email, twitter, or any of the contact methods in the site footer.  I'd love to discuss it with you.</p>

Prevents phones from "zooming out" to display a window/&#x200b;viewport into the page.  This behavior is helpful for sites that are not optimized for mobile presentation, but isn't helpful for this site because it contains mobile-specific css styles



















These next several lines link to various favicon icons (the little icon that shows up in your tab on most modern browsers.  Many sites just link to 1 favicon, but that results in either sending much too large of an icon to all browsers (reducing page speed) on in sending an icon that isn't optimized the the relevant browser.  This code instead sends just the correct icon for each browser.  See <a class="link" href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">realfavicon&#x200b;generator.net/</a>, (which is also the site I used to generate these icons) for more details.


















This is the CSS style for the site.  A few notes:

First, some people would consider it poor practice to inline all the CSS as I have instead of linking to an external file with the css. Linking to an external file has several advantages that make it much more widely used:

<ul><li>It is more maintainable.  Different pages on the site can all link to the same css file, which means that changing formatting for a particular element only requires changing the single css file.  In contrast, if I want to change, say, the color of the navigation bar, then I have to change that piece of css in all my files.</li>

<li>It is typically faster for repeat visitors (or people who visit the site more than once). Once someone has downloaded the css for the first time, the css file will be cached locally, and they won't need to request it from the server.  This means that subsequent requests will be able to load the local resource, which is faster.</li>

<li>It allows resources to be downloaded in parallel. Modern browsers can download multiple files at the same time, which means that the browser can download something else while it is downloading the first css file (such as an image or other css file).  In contrast, with inline css, the browser won't start downloading any resources until it has fully downloaded and parsed the html file.</li>

So, given all those arguments, why did I decide to inline the css for this page?  A few reasons. First of all, most of those arguments only apply to this site very slightly (if at all).  This site is small enough that editing multiple files isn't much of a burden, and I'm prioritizing speed and simplicity so much that each page of this site fits into the initial 14kb TCP request--so my speed penalty for repeat visitors for inline css is minimal (at most ~20ms, even on very slow systems).

There are also a few advantages to inlining my css.  Most importantly, it reduces load time for first-time visitors.  You only get one chance to make a first impression, and I want this it to be a fast one. Inlining all css (and keeping the page size below 14kb) means that we can load the page in a single round-trip from the server--the fastest possible scenario. (This isn't true for pages that have images, but most of my pages don't, and even when they do it still reduces the number of requests.)

Inlining the css also has advantages for my project of making this site as simple as Feynman's radios. It lets me have a single source file that I can point to and say, "There it is.  That file has all you need to know to understand that page on the site".  And I appreciate that simplicity.

Second, the css is written with the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology. See getbem.com/ //TODO expand on this.
