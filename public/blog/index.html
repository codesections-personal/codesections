          <p>I've realized that, as much as I might <em>want</em> to be one of those
people who lives entierly in the terminal, I'm just not.  Don't get me
wrong, I very much enjoy the terminal and my setup in it – coding away
in emacs or vim is very much my preferred professional setup.  But

        </h1>

        
          <p>As I write this, I've now had my Keyboardio Atreus for a full six weeks and have been
using it pretty much exclusively that whole time.  After a month and a half, I've given it
a fair shake and can give you my full impressions.  And my full impression is that it is
<strong>amazing</strong>.</p>
<aside>
<p>This review is <strong>not</strong> a detailed comparison by someone who knows a lot about mechanical
keyboards.  I've heard that the Kailh BOX Brown switches in my keys are pretty good, but I
can't compare them to any other switches.  This is the first mechanical keyboard I've ever
owned – about all I can tell you about the keys is that it sure feels nicer to type on
than my ThinkPad keyboard.  If you're looking for that sort of comparison, you'll need to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0mchmVeh4w">look</a> somewhere
<a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/keyboardio-atreus-yeah-or-meh-review/">else</a>. </p>
<p>This also isn't a short, to-the-point, objective list of pros and cons.  It's less
Consumer Reports, and more <a href="https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/10/09/ergo-rabbit-hole.html">Down the Ergonomic Keyboard Rabbit
Hole</a> (though, tragically,
without the MS Paint illustrations).  As that post seems to prove, apparently at least
<em>some</em> people like reading long, at times idiosyncratic, accounts of a really cool
keyboard setup.  This one is mine – well, mine and the Atreus's, I suppose.</p>
<p>(Though if you are here for brevity, I offer a one-sentence review at the very end.)</p>
</aside>
<h2 id="atreus-background">Atreus background</h2>
<p>Before I tell you what I love about it, what <em>is</em> the Atreus?  Well, it's a keyboard. It's
a <em>tiny</em> keyboard.</p>
<p>More specifically, it's a keyboard with 44 keys – compared with 84 on my ThinkPad
keyboard, and a full 108 on a traditional desktop keyboard.  How does it get by with so
few keys?  More on that in a minute; for now, just focus on how small the thing is,
without needing to cramp any of the individual keys in the least.</p>

        </h1>

        
          <p>In <a href="/blog/raku-manifesto">part 1</a> and <a href="/blog/raku-manifesto-2">part 2</a> I discussed my
personal take on a Raku manifesto: </p>
<div class="highlight">
<ol>
<li><strong>Expressive code         <small>over uniform code</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Rewarding mastery       <small>over ease of learnability</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code           <small>over unsurprising code</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Individual productivity <small>over large-group productivity</small></strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In those posts, I explained how Raku prioritizes each of the values on the left over each of
the values on the right.  I also explained that, in my view, the final value pair –
prioritizing individual productivity over large-group productivity – is the most fundamental
value driving Raku's design.  All the other sets of priorities in my Raku manifesto play a
supporting role in prioritizing individual productivity over large-group productivity.  In
this post, I explain why I'm convinced that Raku made the right call.</p>
<h3 id="why-raku-is-correct-to-prioritize-individual-productivity">Why Raku is correct to prioritize individual productivity</h3>
<p>I mentioned earlier that language designers have recognized the tension between individual
productivity and large group productivity.  If you look at what has been written on the
topic – all the way from the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small">Programming-in-the-Large Versus
Programming-in-the-Small</a>
paper through today – you might get the impression that small scale programming is a solved
problem and that the only interesting/meaningful question is how we increase the
productivity of large software teams.  Certainly many of the programming languages that have
gained popularity recently seem to reflect that view:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th align="left">Developer</th><th align="left">Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Golang</td><td align="left">Google</td><td align="left">build large software projects</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rust</td><td align="left">Mozilla</td><td align="left">build large software projects</td></tr>
<tr><td>TypeScript</td><td align="left">Microsoft</td><td align="left">build large software projects</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hask</td><td align="left">Facebook</td><td align="left">build large software projects</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Looking at that list, you might conclude that we clearly need a programming language for
large projects and that older languages do fine for smaller groups.</p>
<p>You <em>might</em>, but you shouldn't.</p>

        </h1>

        
          <p>If you recall from <a href="/blog/raku-manifesto">part 1 in this series</a>, we're talking about my
personal take on a Raku manifesto (modeled loosely after the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile
Manifesto</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight">
<ol>
<li><strong>Expressive code         <small>over uniform code</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Rewarding mastery       <small>over ease of learnability</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Powerful code           <small>over unsurprising code</small></strong></li>
<li><strong>Individual productivity <small>over large-group productivity</small></strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In part 1, I discussed how and why I believe that Raku values expressive code over uniform
code and rewarding mastery over providing a fast learning curve.  Now,
we're ready to move on to the third value pair.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-code-over-unsurprising-code">Powerful code over unsurprising code</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least
astonishment</a> is a
fundamental maxim of computer science that states code is far clearer when its behavior can
be easily predicted; code is far more head-scratchingly confusing when it triggers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_%28computer_programming%29">spooky
action at a
distance</a>.</p>
<aside>
<p>The &quot;Action at a distance&quot; Wikipedia page calls out just one example as particularly
emblematic of the anti-pattern it's describing: the <code>$[</code> operator from Perl 5, which it
cites to <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/1999/11/sins.html/">Sins of Perl Revisited</a>.  I'm happy
to report that Raku (which, recall, was formerly known as Perl 6) has removed pretty much
all of these action-at-a-distance variables.  One of the <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2007/12/06/soto-11.html/">design
goals</a> all along has been to &quot;make
different mistakes&quot; than Perls 1 through 5 – I guess this is one area where we've succeeded.</p>
</aside>
<p>Rust provides a particularly clear example of this principle in action: Rust doesn't let you
override existing operators for existing types; it doesn't let you declare a function
without fully defining the types; it doesn't let you have default arguments; it doesn't let
you call a macro without using the <code>!</code> character that sets that call apart from function
calls.  Rust is powerful enough that it <em>could</em> let you break any of these rules, but it
doesn't – enforcing those rules keeps the language less surprising, and thus makes it much
easier to reason about.</p>
<p>And Rust is hardly alone in this regard.  Indeed, the majority of programming languages
don't allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading">operator overloading</a> and
even fewer allow the programmer to define new operators.  Put differently, most languages
are willing to deny programmers the considerable power of user-defined operators to keep the
language less surprising.</p>
<h3 id="how-raku-values-unsurprising-code">How Raku values unsurprising code</h3>
<p>I've already mentioned one way Raku helps prevent nasty surprises: eliminating the
action-at-a-distance variables that were so sinful in Perl 5.  Raku has also thoroughly
embraced lexical scoping; even when you modify Raku's very syntax, your changes will be
limited to your current lexical block.  And, as I mentioned in <a href="/blog/raku-maifesto">part
1</a>, Raku strongly supports both object-oriented and functional
programming – each of which, in its own way, promotes predictable code.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that I'm a fan of agile software development (at least as it's commonly
practiced).  But I am sure that the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> got one
thing <em>really</em> right: It not only stated what values were important but also stated which
values (though important!) could be sacrificed.  That is, the Agile Manifesto was explicit
about what tradeoffs it was willing to make.</p>
<p>That's crucial because it's really easy to select some nice-sounding phrases and label
them as &quot;priorities&quot; – who wouldn't agree that &quot;<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">readability
counts</a>&quot;?  But it's much harder to pick out
important values that you're willing to sacrifice.  And, because it's harder, it's also
much more revealing.  You'll often learn a lot more from knowing a project's non-goals
than from knowing its goals.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I'd like to present a similar manifesto for the <a href="https://raku.org/">Raku programming
language</a>.  Note: I said &quot;<strong>a</strong>&quot; manifesto, not &quot;<strong>the</strong>&quot; manifesto for
Raku.  I'm speaking only for myself; I'm sure many others would include different
dichotomies on their version of a Raku manifesto.  Additionally, this is very much a first
draft.  I've put considerable thought into this but haven't yet discussed my views broadly.
I also artificially limited myself to four pairs of values (following the form set by the
Agile Manifesto), and I could easily imagine changing my mind.  If you disagree or just have
a different perspective, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/j0vq6u/a_raku_manifesto_part_1/?">r/rakulang</a>
thread for this post on the <a href="https://raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel</a>.</p>
<aside>
<p>In this post, I'll be contrasting Raku with other programming languages.  Nothing I'm
saying is intended as a criticism of the other languages I mention; they all have
strengths and are good for particular use cases.  My only goal in bringing them up at all
is to make the contrast with Raku more concrete and reflect on how languages are willing
to make tradeoffs that reflect their design goals.</p>
<p>In particular, I'll mention <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> pretty often.  This isn't because
I think Golang is a poorly designed language – quite the reverse, in fact.  I think Golang
is an extremely <em>well</em> designed language, and one where the designers have been wonderfully
explicit about their design goals.  I also think that Golang's design goals are, in many
cases, the exact opposite of Raku's, which makes it a particularly useful contrast. </p>
</aside>
<p>Before we get started, I want to remind you of a statement from the Agile Manifesto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel the same way.  All the items on the right side of the chart up above (the items that
come after &quot;over&quot;) are still <em>really</em> important.  So, in this series of posts, I'm going to
walk through the four value pairs in my Raku manifesto.  I'll discuss the first two pairs in
this post, and the next two in the second post.  For each pair, I'll say why the value on
the right side is important, and what Raku does to support it.  Then I'll say why, in my
view, the value on the left is even <strong>more</strong> important (for the language Raku is trying to
be, anyway), and how Raku prioritizes it in ways that require sacrificing the value on the
right.  After discussing all four value pairs, I'll close with a post on why I believe that
Raku's decision to prioritize the values on the left is absolutely the correct one.</p>

        </h1>

        
          <p>Yesterday, I got curious about a simple question that sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. But now I've emerged from the hole, and want to share what I've learned. (Should that be &quot;share the rabbits I caught&quot;? I think I'll just drop this analogy before we end up with any dead rabbits.)</p>
<p>This journey will take us deep into the internals of Raku, Rakudo, Not Quite Perl, and even Moar. But don't worry – this will still be relevant to our everyday use of Raku, even if you (like me!) aren't in the habit of writing any NQP.</p>
<p>Here was the question: What's the cleanest way to match the alphabetic ASCII characters in a Raku regex? Simple enough, right?</p>
<p>My first thought was something like this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#002b36;">
<code><span style="color:#839496;">say ‘</span><span style="color:#2aa198;">Raku&#39;s mascot: »ö«</span><span style="color:#839496;">’ ~~ m:g</span><span style="color:#2aa198;">/&lt;[A..Za..z]&gt;+/</span><span style="color:#839496;">;
    </span><span style="color:#586e75;"># OUTPUT: «(｢Raku｣ ｢s｣ ｢mascot｣)»
</span></code></pre>
<p>And that works and is admirably concise. But it suffers from (what I view as) a fatal flaw: it looks <em>exactly</em> like the code someone would write when they want to match all alphabetic characters but forgot that they need to handle Unicode. One rule I try to stick with is that correct code shouldn't <em>look</em> buggy; breaking that rule is a good way to spend time &quot;debugging&quot; functional code. If I did use the syntax above, I'd probably feel the need to add an explanatory comment (or break it out into a named regex).</p>
<p>That's all pretty minor, but it got me curious. So I decided to see what people thought on the <a href="https://raku.org/community/irc">#raku IRC channel</a> – always a good source of advice. After some helpful comments, I wound up with this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#002b36;">
<code><span style="color:#839496;">say ‘</span><span style="color:#2aa198;">Raku&#39;s mascot: »ö«</span><span style="color:#839496;">’ ~~ m:g</span><span style="color:#2aa198;">/[&lt;:ASCII&gt; &amp; &lt;.alpha&gt;]+/</span><span style="color:#839496;">;
    </span><span style="color:#586e75;"># OUTPUT: «(｢Raku｣ ｢s｣ ｢mascot｣)»
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's a whole lot better. It's slightly longer, but much more explicit.</p>
<p>But – hang on! – what is that <code>&lt;:ASCII&gt;</code> character class? That's not in <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Unicode_properties">the docs</a>! Is it missing from the documentation? If so, I could add it – I've been trying to do my part with updating the docs.</p>
<p>Well, no, it isn't missing. Raku supports querying <strong>all</strong> Unicode character properties, and you can access a large number of them in a regex using the <code>:property_name</code> syntax.</p>
<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself: this post is about the journey of figuring out the answers to three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What Unicode properties does Raku actually support? (spoiler: all of them, sort of)</li>
<li>How does Raku enable its Unicode support?</li>
<li>What additional power does this give us when writing Raku code?</li>
</ol>
<p>So, how do we start?</p>

        </h1>

        
          <p>Maybe you already know this, but it took me <em>way</em> too long to realize it so I'm going to talk about it anyway: <strong>Pod is not Pod6</strong>.</p>
<aside>
<p>This post is entirely about the Pod6 documentation language. If you're not familiar with Pod6, it's a lightweight markup language that can be rendered to Markdown, HTML, plaintext, or a variety of other output formats; you can think of it a bit like a more powerful and flexible version of Markdown. It was originally designed to <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/pod">make inline Raku documentation</a> as pleasant as possible to write, but you can use it anywhere you might want to generate HTML or another output format – in fact, I've started <a href="https://github.com/codesections-personal/codesections/tree/master/pod-src">writing this blog</a> in Pod6. There's even a dedicated <a href="https://zahatski.com/2020/7/22/1/podlite-open-source-pod6-markup-language-editor">editor</a> for writing Pod6 and rendering realtime HTML output.</aside></p>
<p>I want to be clear about what I'm <em>not</em> saying. My point isn't that Pod6 is a different language from <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html">POD</a>, aka Plain Ol' Documentation, the markup language used for Perl 5 documentation. That's <em>true</em>, of course – Pod6 and POD are not the same language – but I'm making a different point.</p>
<p>The point I'm making is that Pod6 and Pod aren't the same language any more that JSON and JavaScript objects are the same language. In fact, Pod6 and Pod have a relationship that is exactly analogous to JSON and JavaScript objects: like JSON, Pod6 is a notation for writing plaintext files that can be read both by humans and machines; like a JavaScript object, Pod is an in-memory representation of that content.</p>
<p>Put differently, Pod6 is a <strong>markup language</strong>, and Pod is a <strong>data format</strong>. </p>

        </h1>

        
          <p>The other day (er, ok, month) Brian Wisti wrote an excellent blog post about <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/07/tangling-code-from-hugo-content-with-raku/">tangling code using Raku</a>.</p>
<aside>
<p>In case you're not familiar with it, the term &quot;tangling&quot; comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> movement. In literate programming, you write a single file containing <strong>both</strong> source code and extensive, narrative documentation and then process that file in two ways: you <em>weave</em> the file into documentation designed for human consumption and you <em>tangle</em> the file into code designed to be executed. The idea is that you can use this technique to write a program the way you'd write an essay (or a blog post): explain your thoughts as you go, and carry the reader along your thought process.</aside></p>
<h2 id="inverse-inspiration">Inverse inspiration</h2>
<p>My first thought when reading that post was that I want exactly what it describes. My <strong>second</strong> thought, however, is that I don't – I actually want the exact <em>inverse</em> of what the post describes.</p>
<p>Brian wants to start by writing documentation and then to tangle code out of that file and into one or more executable programs. In his example, Brian starts by writing a Markdown file, and then processes it to produce multiple executable files in multiple programming languages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I want to start by writing some code – specifically, some Raku code – and then to weave documentation out of that file. Like Brian, I want to write one file that both tells a story and produces machine-executable code; unlike Brian, I want to start a bit closer to the code, and generate the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="wait-isn-t-that-just-pod6">Wait, isn't that just Pod6?</h2>
<p>At first, this could sound like I'm just describing Pod6, Raku's <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/pod">excellent tool for writing and formatting documentation</a>. Using Pod6, it's already easy to write clear, well-formatted documentation directly in-line with your code. And you can then <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/pod#Rendering_Pod">render the documentation</a> as Markdown, HTML, plain text, or <a href="https://modules.raku.org/search/?q=pod%3A%3Ato">any other output format</a> you'd like. Isn't that exactly what I said I wanted?</p>
<p>Well, no, not exactly. A Raku file with Pod blocks is cleanly divided into <em>documentation</em> (everything inside Pod blocks) and <em>code</em> (everything outside Pod blocks). When you render output documentation, the code is ignored; when you run the code, the documentation is ignored.</p>
<p>This works great for many typical Pod use cases, but it doesn't really let us do the sort of thing Brian was talking about: we can't use Pod to write code and to <em>display that code as part of our documentation</em>. That's a little abstract, so maybe an example is in order.</p>

          <p>I've been really falling in love with the <a href="https://raku.org">Raku</a>
programming language – it's powerful, expressive, has great support
for introspection, strong pattern matching, and <strong>extremely</strong> good
support for metaprogramming.  I'm pretty much sold on using it for any
project where I don't need raw performance.  (When I do need raw
performance, I still reach for Rust).</p>
<p>That said, there are a few niceties and patterns I miss from Rust.
Fortunately, Raku is powerful enough to make nearly all of them
possible, usually with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>Today, I'd like to talk about one example: Writing unit tests in the
same file as the code under test, without any runtime cost thanks to
conditional compilation.</p>

          <p>I recently read Andrei Cioara's take on <a href="https://andreicioara.com/how-i-organize-my-github-repositories-ce877db2e8b6">the best way to organize GitHub repos</a>.  The short version is that GitHub's flat name-spacing leaves all your repos in a single, jumbled list—which is both annoying for you to deal with and makes it harder for anyone else to find your most useful projects.</p>
<p>In particular, if you're an active participant in the open-source world, you could easily have dozens of forks cluttering up your repo list, not to mention any old, half-finished projects you might have floating around.</p>
<p>Andrei suggests a clever solution: Create single-user organizations and move certain repositories over to those organizations. For example, I've created a <code>codesections-forks</code> organization to hold all the projects I've forked to make pull requests and a <code>codesections-playground</code> repo to hold my one-off experiments.  As a result, my main <a href="https://github.com/codesections?tab=repositories">repository page</a> is now much cleaner—down to just 13 public repos, all of which I actively maintain.</p>
<p>But what Andrei <strong>doesn't</strong> explain is how to move all your repos.  If you do it through GitHub's UI, it's pretty painful—you have to click through several different pages and manually type in <em>both</em> the name of the repo you want to move <em>and</em> the target org.  And—since the only reason this is worth doing is if you have a bunch of repos you'd like to move—this ends up being a lengthy process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a better way.</p>
