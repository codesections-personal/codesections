#I 
Lately, I've spent some time with the final projects put together by recent graduates of good programing bootcamps.  Many of them are quite impressiveâ€”they not only show off fluency with the latests web development practices and frameworks, but also solve real problems.  Many of the final projects seem like they could be full-fledged buisnesses, and it's impressive that four relatively junior coders could put them together in just four weeks. 

Other projects, however, are a bit different.  I don't intend to be too critical, but some projects strike me as dramtically over-built.
